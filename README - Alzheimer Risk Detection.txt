# Alzheimer Risk Detection

## Description
This project predicts the risk of Alzheimer's disease using a neural network built with TensorFlow and Keras. It leverages clinical data, sourced from the Kaggle dataset ([Alzheimer's Disease Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rabieelkharoua/alzheimers-disease-dataset)), to classify individuals into risk categories. The model utilizes preprocessing, visualization, and advanced neural network techniques for accurate and interpretable predictions.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Includes cleaning, normalization, and splitting into training and test sets.
- **Neural Network**: Built using TensorFlow and Keras for binary classification (e.g., high vs. low risk).
- **Visualizations**: Uses Matplotlib and Seaborn for data exploration and insights.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Reports accuracy, loss, and other key metrics to evaluate model performance.
